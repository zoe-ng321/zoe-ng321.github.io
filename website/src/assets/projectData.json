      sensor and a mobile application, and it allows users to view compliance data in real-time and receive incentives to wear their brace.

    "description":"HackTX 2018 Project: Worked on a team of five to create a web application that
      identifies and leverages customer sentiments for American Airlines customers in real time.
      The app displays sentiment analysis of live conversations and parses keywords to understand
      the conversation topic and the sentiment associated with the topic. The project was created
      using React, Material UI, Recharts, Flask, MongoDB, RevSpeech API, and the Microsoft Azure
      Text Analysis API. We placed in the top 10 projects overall and won third place for the American
      Airlines challenge, and we developed the project during the 24-hour hackathon.
